# Rust-Threads

Rust-Threads is a simple CPU load generator implemented in Rust. It leverages Rust's powerful multithreading capabilities to stress test your CPU. By calculating the factorials of numbers and their logarithms in parallel, this project showcases both Rust's efficiency and its prowess in concurrent computing.

The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!, and it can grow very rapidly with the size of n. This makes it an excellent candidate for testing the capabilities of a CPU.

To represent these large factorials, Rust-Threads uses the logarithm base 10. The Stirling's approximation formula is used to calculate the number of digits in a factorial, which is log10(n!) â‰ˆ n * log10(n) - n * log10(e).
