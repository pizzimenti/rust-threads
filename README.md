# Rust-Threads

Rust-Threads is a simple CPU load generator implemented in Rust written by GPT-4 with 17 human prompts, including the creation of this README. It leverages Rust's powerful multithreading capabilities to saturate your CPU. By calculating the factorials of numbers and their logarithms in parallel, it takes advantage of Rust's efficiency in concurrent computing to gently warm your room.

Rust-Threads uses Stirling's approximation to calculate the number of digits in a factorial, which is log10(n!) â‰ˆ n * log10(n) - n * log10(e). You will be prompted for the number of digits to compute for in each loop. This will run until killed by the user.

## Installation

To install Rust-Threads, you need to have Rust installed. You can download Rust from the official website at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, you can clone this repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pizzimenti/rust-threads.git
cd rust-threads
cargo run
```
